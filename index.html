            Hello, my name is Sue Duclos. I am the oldest of three in a military family. My father was in the Army where he met my mother while stationed in Korea. I have grown up primarily in a small town in Oklahoma and lived overseas for eight years of my childhood in Germany. I attended the University of Oklahoma and moved to the Seattle area after college. I am married and have three beautiful children. I enjoy reading, cooking, crafts and quilting in my spare time.
